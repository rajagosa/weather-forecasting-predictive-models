This project explores global weather data to forecast temperature trends using two different modeling approaches: Facebook Prophet and XGBoost. After cleaning and analyzing over 60,000 rows of weather data, I focused on a specific location (Kuwait City) to build and evaluate predictive models. I used Prophet to capture time-based seasonality and trends, while XGBoost was trained using engineered datetime features. Both models were evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), with Prophet slightly outperforming XGBoost in this case.

Beyond just model performance, this project also offered insights into how temperature patterns vary seasonally and how different modeling techniques interpret those trends. The visual comparisons and metrics helped highlight the strengths and tradeoffs between machine learning and time-series forecasting. This was a great hands-on opportunity to apply data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques to a real-world dataset.
